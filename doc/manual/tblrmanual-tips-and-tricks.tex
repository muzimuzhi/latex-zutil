\chapter{Tips and Tricks}

\section{Control Horizontal Alignment}

You can control horizontal alignment of cells in \texttt{tabularray} with
\href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ragged2e}{\texttt{ragged2e}} package,
by redefining some of the following commands:

\begin{codehigh}
\RenewDocumentCommand\TblrAlignBoth{}{\justifying}
\RenewDocumentCommand\TblrAlignLeft{}{\RaggedRight}
\RenewDocumentCommand\TblrAlignCenter{}{\Centering}
\RenewDocumentCommand\TblrAlignRight{}{\RaggedLeft}
\end{codehigh}

Please read the documentation of \texttt{ragged2e} package for more details of
their alignment commands.

\section{Use Safe Verbatim Commands}%
\label{sec:fakeverb}

Due to the limitation of TeX, even if you have passed \texttt{verb} option to a
\texttt{tabularray} table, you still could not use some special characters in a
\verb!\verb! command. As an replacement, you may use \verb|\fakeverb| command from \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/codehigh}{\texttt{codehigh}} package.

The \verb|\fakeverb| command will remove the backslashes in the following control symbols before
typesetting its content: \fakeverb{\\\\}, \fakeverb{\\\{}, \fakeverb{\\\}}, \fakeverb{\\\#}, \fakeverb{\\\^} and \texttt{\textbackslash\textvisiblespace}, \fakeverb{\\\%}.
Also the argument of \verb|\fakeverb| command need to be enclosed with curly braces.
Therefore it could be safely used inside \verb|tabularray| tables and other LaTeX commands.

Here is an example of using \verb!\fakeverb! commands inside a \verb|tblr| environment
(you don't need \texttt{verb} option to use \verb!\fakeverb!):

\begin{demohigh}
\begin{tblr}{hlines}
  Special & \fakeverb{\abc{}$&^_^uvw 123} \\
  Spacing & \fakeverb{\bfseries\ \#\%}    \\
  Nesting & \fbox{\fakeverb{$\left\\\{A\right.$\#}}
\end{tblr}
\end{demohigh}

In the above example, balanced curly braces and control words (such as \verb!\bfseries!)
need not to be escaped---only several special characters need to be escaped.
Please read the documentation of \texttt{codehigh} package for more details of
\verb|\fakeverb| commands.%
\footnote{By the way, \fakeverb{\EscVerb} command from
\href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/fvextra}{\texttt{fvextra}} package is similar to
\fakeverb{\fakeverb} command, but with \fakeverb{\EscVerb} you need to escape every control word.}
